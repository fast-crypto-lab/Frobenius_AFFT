## Introduction

Binary polynomial multiplication, i.e. polynomial multiplication over the boolean field, arises in many hardware applications, such as Reed-Solomon codes and cryptographic applications like AES.

The best-known algorithm for small binary polynomial multiplications is the Karatsuba algorithm, while larger binary polynomials typically use FFT-based algorithms. However, the exact optimal circuit complexity for binary polynomial multiplications of around 1024 bits remains unknown. Finding more efficient algorithms is both practically and theoretically important.

We propose a new algorithm for binary polynomial multiplication using the Frobenius Additive Fast Fourier Transform (AFFFT), which is a generalization of the classical FFT.

We provide a circuit generator that produces bit operations (AND & XOR) for binary polynomial multiplication using the AFFFT algorithm developed in our paper [Frobenius Additive Fast Fourier Transform](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3208976.3208998).

The generated circuit has a butterfly structure that can be used for pipelined implementation.

## Usage

```bash
$ python affft_codegen.py [log_2(input_size)]
```

Example:
```bash
$ python affft_codegen.py 8
```
The above command will generate bit operations of binary polynomial multiplication with two input size 256 and output size 512
